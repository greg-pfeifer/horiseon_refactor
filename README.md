This project was completed for the purpose of refactoring the Horiseon home page. The refactoring involved combining redundant CSS selectors; replacing div elements in the HTML code with more specific, semantic elements; adding alt text to images; adding text descriptions of code changes in both the HTML and CSS files. The refactoring makes the code more readable and user-friendly.
